<p>"The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, 
    the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies 
    were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. 
    We are made of starstuff." - Carl Sagan</p>

    <li>Observation can affect reality.</li>
    <li>Gravitational fields do not put forces on objects, 
        instead they cause space-time to bend.</li>
    <li>Mass tells space-time how to bend 
        and space-time tells mass how to move</li>
